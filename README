GDELT_PROJECT:  parse analyze and map gdelt data
================================================

1- run ./install_for_clickhouse.sh on your terminal

2- go make yourself a coffee

(the intermediate CSV files are being removed as we insert them into the database, no need to tidy things up)


3- you're all set, you can request your database: try 
                                                   SELECT count(*) from gdelt;

4 - feel free to check out the gdelt data structure here: http://www.gdeltproject.org/data.html#documentation
